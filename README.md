# Cookiecutter Data Science

This is my custom extension of the pre-existing cookiecutter-data-science template. Additions include:

* GPU drivers installation / set-up
* AWS syncing of data from/to designated S3 buckets
* Dataset creation script that automatically runs a pipeline given (1) an ordered list of scripts (should be placed in /src/data/scripts) and (2) their corresponding optional arguments for the main function.  
* Autoatic installation of some important data science modules in Python, including:
  * Numpy
  * Scipy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * OpenCV
  * PyTorch
